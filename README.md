Hey there. Just to clarify. SourceData is the upload of the data to your machine that the user have uploaded. Steps To run the program and test it out. Download the folder and place it on the Desktop. 
Run VSCode and open a new file on it which is MLAnalysis.py After words get to the Terminal(PowerShell) and write a command: streamlit run MLAnalysis.py and the localHost should open on your browser.
Then you can add any csv file up to 200mb of size and test out the feauture for Pandas analysis and Training of different ML models for a specific variable from the dataset. P.S. the The bigger the csv longer it will take to analysize it and Train it.
For Example The csv file called "UploadData" is the dataset I used and since its quit large it took it 3mins to analyse with pandas and it took around 10mins to train multiple Algorithms on specific variable from the dataset. 
In the Dataset I used, I train the models on a variable "CUSTOMER_REVIEWS" and out of all models the Classification had the highest accuracy score of 0.63 By knowing this we can see which models are not fitted for our case and which do. so later in production we can focus on one specific Model to use for our busnises purpose.
Additionaly after finishing Training and Analysis in the folder with the application the txt file called logs will appear. Also after training the Programm shows which model had the highest score and in Download section you will be able to download the best Train Model.
